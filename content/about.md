<p>>>> Welcome to my portfolio website. 
I'm Angelo Pennati.  

I was born in Milan (Italy) and studied Neuroscience and Economics at NYU. I am also currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Science (Machine Learning track) from Johns Hopkins University. 

I first landed in the coding world as a researcher in Weiji Ma's Computational Neuroscience Laboratory, and have continued to chase its white rabbit ever since.</p>
