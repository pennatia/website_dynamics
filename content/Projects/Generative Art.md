## Context
This Generative Art section is really more related to a passion project, which includes a few separate little explorations into the world of generative art, completed in Python. 

## Scope & Methodology
Generally, the projects in the repos listed below are completed using Python's Cairo Package, the only exception being the ASCII converter (with which the image you see on the bottom of the screen was originally created)

Here, I attempt to generate some art generatively through code, in order to create single, non-replicable vector graphics, like those you can find in the github repos.
